◯◯ちゃん:

Hello!

私は、時間の恋愛に悩まされています。彼氏は、過去にいた女性との関係があります。彼は、その女性との結婚を計画しているようです。彼と話すときには、彼女との話題を避けているのですが、私は非常に困惑しています。

彼と出会う前、私は彼の過去を知らなかったため、私は彼を完全に信頼していた。でも、後になって、彼の過去を知ってしまったらしく、私は彼に対する信頼が揺らいでした。

彼氏が彼女との関係を解消したいと言っているが、私は信じていない。彼は、彼女との関係を解消するために、私と結婚するつもりはないと思います。私の恋は、時間の恋愛のように過去との距離感に悩まされています。

私は、彼との恋愛を続けるかどうかを悩んでいるのです。彼との関係を続けたいと考える一方、私は、彼の過去を忘れることができないのです。

結局、私は、彼との恋愛を続けるのかどうかを決断する必要があります。彼との関係を続けることで、彼の過去を忘れられるのかもしれないし、私は彼と一緒にいることで、より大きな愛を感じることができるかもしれません。


(以上)


◯◯ちゃん: Hello!

I'm troubled by the time of love. My boyfriend has a past relationship, and he's planning to get married to that woman. When we talk, he avoids talking about her, but I'm really troubled.

Before meeting him, I didn't know about his past, so I completely trusted him. But after finding out about his past, my trust in him is wavering.

He says he wants to break up with her, but I don't believe him. I think he won't break up with her just to be with me. My love is troubled by the distance between the past and present.

I'm undecided whether to continue my love for him or not. I want to continue the relationship, but I can't forget his past.

In the end, I need to make a decision about whether to continue the relationship or not. If I continue the relationship, maybe I can forget his past, or I might feel a deeper love with him if I'm with him.</p>

◯◯姉さん: Ah, I see. It sounds like you're feeling torn between your love for him and your concerns about his past. It's natural to feel that way, especially when you've invested your emotions in someone.

Let's break down the core of your problem: it seems like you're worried that he might not truly break up with her and that his past is still affecting your current relationship.

Now, let's look at this situation from a different angle. When you first met him, you didn't know about his past, and you trusted him completely. That trust was built on a foundation of innocence and ignorance. But now that you know his past, you're facing the reality of his relationships.

In a way, his past is still present in your relationship, and that can be uncomfortable. But, at the same time, it's possible that his past experiences have shaped him into the person he is today, and that's a part of who he is.

Here's a gentle reminder: you can't control the past, but you can control how you react to it. If you choose to continue the relationship, it's essential to communicate openly with him about your concerns and boundaries.

Remember, love is complex, and relationships involve many factors. You deserve to feel secure and understood in your relationship. Take your time, and think about what's truly important to you.
